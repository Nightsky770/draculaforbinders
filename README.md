All content (text and images) is in the public domain in the United States. Fonts used, to the best of my knowledge, are free to use for any purpose including commercial. Whatever original work of mine this effort represents, I place into the public domain. In other words, to the best of my knowledge you may make and sell copies of this. I am not a lawyer and you are responsible for compliance with your government's copyright law(s).

I have assumed throughout that you are using borderless printing. If your printer adds a border, you will need to make adjustments--the easiest way I've found is to increase BCOR by $borderwidth*2. For my own use (my own printer does not support borderless printing) I also set DIV to an artificially high 15, for smaller margins (since these will be enlarged in printing).

I am now doing 5-sheet signatures for longer works like this one.

If you are using US letter paper (8.5" x 11"), download the "letter" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

If you are using A4 paper, download the "A4" folder containing the signatures and print them out, double-sided, flip on short side.

LaTeX originals are in the source folder. You do not need them unless you are preparing your own version.
